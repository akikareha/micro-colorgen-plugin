# Color Generator Plugin

**Color Generator** is a fun plugin that randomly generates a new 16-color
colorscheme each time you run the command.

## Usage

Run the following command:

```
colorgen
```

Or press `Ctrl-Alt-l` to instantly generate and switch to a new random
colorscheme.

## Note

Each generated scheme is named `colorgen1`, `colorgen2`, ..., and is not saved
permanently.
